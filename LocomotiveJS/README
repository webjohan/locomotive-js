When creating a view you always get access to the views varables with the view object.
The variables from the url is always stored as the name that you assign it.

The :id is optional and specified in your urls configuration.

Creating a view:

app.get('/someURL/:id/', function(request, response) {

	var id = request.view.id;
	
	var context = { 'userid':id };
		
	resolver.renderTemplate('/someTemplate.html', context, request, response);
});
